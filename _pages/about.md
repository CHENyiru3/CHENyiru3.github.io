Hi there! My name is Yiru CHEN, and current I am an undergraduate student in bioinformatics program in ZJE institution (https://zje.zju.edu.cn/yjld/list.htm), Zhejiang University, China. With the powerful computational methods, I feel extremly exciting to explore more about the story behind the biological phenomena. 

I have received several hard-core computaional biological academic traning experiences from multiple research inistitution, including Zhejiang University, Vanderbilt University, and Georgia Tech. Now I have active interests in algortihm development for spatial omics and computational immunology.
